## Implementation Details

### C Language Implementation
-  **Source Code**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void matrix_multiply(int *A, int *B, int *C, int n) {
    // Multiply n x n matrices A and B, store result in C
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            C[i * n + j] = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                C[i * n + j] += A[i * n + k] * B[k * n + j];
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 2; // Example 2x2 matrices
    int A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int B[] = {5, 6, 7, 8};
    int *C = malloc(n * n * sizeof(int));

    matrix_multiply(A, B, C, n);

    // Print result

            printf("%d ", C[i * n + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    free(C);
    return 0;
}
```

**Compilation Command**: 
- To compile the C program using GCC, The Following Command is executed   **gcc -o matrix matrix.c**

**Component Description**
- **gcc**: Invokes the GNU Compiler Collection to compile the C code.
- **o matrix**: Specifies the output file name for the compiled executable (in this case, "matrix").
- **matrix.c**: The source file containing your C code for matrix multiplication. This command translates the C source code into a machine-readable executable file named matrix. If there are no errors in your code, it will create the matrix executable in your current directory.

**Execution Command**
- To run the compiled program, The Following Command is executed  **./matrix**
- **./**: Tells the terminal to look in the current directory for the executable.
- **matrix**: The name of the compiled executable file. Running this command executes the program, which will perform the matrix multiplication as defined in your C code and display the output in the terminal.

### Python Language Implementation
-  **Source Code**
```python
# Define the matrix multiplication function
def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    n = len(A)  # Get the size of the matrices (assuming square matrices)
    # Initialize result matrix C with zeros, using list comprehension
    C = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Perform matrix multiplication using nested loops
    for i in range(n):          # Iterate over rows of A
        for j in range(n):      # Iterate over columns of B
            for k in range(n):  # Iterate over elements to compute dot product
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]  # Update C[i][j] with the product
    return C  # Return the resulting matrix

# Main block to test the implementation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example 2x2 matrices for testing
    A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]  # First matrix
    B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]  # Second matrix
    # Call the matrix_multiply function
    C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
    # Print the result matrix
    for row in C:
        print(row)  # Output each row of the resulting matrix
```
- **Define the matrix multiplication function**: This marks the start of the core function.
- **Get the size of the matrices**: Thiss assumes square matrices and determines their size.
-**Initialize result matrix C with zeros**: This creates a zero-filled matrix to store the result.
- **Perform matrix multiplication using nested loops**: This explains the triple-loop structure for matrix multiplication.
- **Update C[i][j] with the product**: Description of the key computation step.
- **Main block to test the implementation**: This indicates the test code that runs when the script is executed.
- **Example 2x2 matrices for testing**: This provides sample input for verification

**Execution Command**
To run the Python script, the following command is excuted: **python3  matrix.py**

**Description:**

-   python3: Invokes the Python 3 interpreter (use python3 instead of python on most Linux systems like WSL to ensure the correct version).
-   matrix.py: The name of the Python script file containing the matrix multiplication code. Running this command executes the script, which will compute the matrix multiplication for the example matrices A and B and print the resulting matrix C to the terminal.

## Algorithm Verification 
#### Correctness
Inorder to verify the correctness of the matrix multiplication algorithm implemented in both C and Python, the following method was explored carefully:

**Manual Calculation with Small Matrices:**
A simple 2x2 matrix multiplication problem was chosen as a test case because its result can be easily computed by hand. For example:
        -   Matrix A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
        -   Matrix B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
  
    -   The expected result was calculated manually:
        -   C[0][0] = (1 * 5) + (2 * 7) = 5 + 14 = 19
        -   C[0][1] = (1 * 6) + (2 * 8) = 6 + 16 = 22
        -   C[1][0] = (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 15 + 28 = 43
        -   C[1][1] = (3 * 6) + (4 * 8) = 18 + 32 = 50
        -   Expected result: C = [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
   
**Comparison with Program Output:**
The same matrices A and B were used as input for both the C and Python implementations.
The C program (compiled and executed with ./matrix) and the Python script (run with python3 matrix.py) produced their respective outputs.
 - The output from both programs was compared to the manually calculated result:
 - C output: 19 22 43 50 (formatted as a 2x2 matrix: [[19, 22], [43, 50]])
  - Python output: [19, 22] [43, 50] (formatted as a 2x2 matrix: [[19, 22], [43, 50]])
   - Both outputs matched the expected result exactly.

**Consistency Across Implementations:**
- The results from the C and Python implementations were cross-checked against each other to ensure consistency. Since both programs produced identical outputs for the same input, this further confirmed the correctness of the algorithm in both languages.

**Edge Case Testing:**

    -   To ensure robustness, additional test cases were considered, such as:
        -   Multiplying matrices with all zeros (e.g., A = [[0, 0], [0, 0]], B = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]), expecting an all-zero result: [[0, 0], [0, 0]].
        -   Multiplying identity matrices (e.g., A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], B = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]), expecting the same identity matrix as the result.
    -   Both implementations correctly handled these cases, reinforcing the algorithm’s reliability.
  
**Conclusion:** 
- The correctness of the matrix multiplication algorithm was verified by manually computing the result for a small, manageable test case, comparing it with the outputs of both the C and Python programs, ensuring consistency between the two implementations, and testing edge cases. This multi-step approach confirmed that the algorithm accurately performs matrix multiplication as intended.





## Performance Analysis
#### Execution Times

- To compare the performance of the C and Python implementations, execution times were measured for matrix multiplication of square matrices of size 100x100. The C program was run using the time command in the WSL terminal, and the Python script was modified to include timing using the time module. Each implementation was executed multiple times, and the average time was recorded. 
- Below is a table summarizing the results:

|Language = C|Execution Time = 0.015  |
|--|--|
| **Language = Pyhon** |**Execution Time = 0.780** |


**Measurement Details:**

-   **C:** Command used: time ./matrix. The real time (wall-clock time) was averaged over 5 runs.
-   **Python:** Modified matrix.py to include:
 ```python 
 python  
 import time
start = time.time()
```
```c
C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
end = time.time()
print(f"Execution Time: {end - start} seconds")
```
    Averaged over 5 runs with python3 matrix.py.
- Matrices were initialized with random integers between 0 and 10 for consistency.

#### Analysis

The performance difference between the C and Python implementations is significant, with C being approximately 50 times faster than Python for this task. Several factors contribute to this disparity:

**Language Execution Models:**
  -   **C (Compiled Language):** C code is compiled directly into machine code by GCC, allowing the CPU to execute it natively. This eliminates runtime interpretation overhead, making it highly efficient for computation-intensive tasks like matrix multiplication.
    -   **Python (Interpreted Language):** Python code is executed by an interpreter (CPython in this case), which processes each line at runtime. This introduces overhead, especially in nested loops, as the interpreter must repeatedly translate high-level instructions into machine code.
    
**Memory Management:**
   -   **C:** Uses manual memory management (e.g., malloc and free in the example). The programmer has direct control over memory allocation, and arrays are stored contiguously in memory, optimizing cache usage during the triple-loop multiplication.
    -   **Python:** Relies on automatic memory management with a garbage collector. The list-of-lists structure used for matrices (C = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]) is not contiguous in memory, leading to slower access times and potential cache misses. Additionally, Python’s dynamic typing adds overhead to arithmetic operations.
    
**Optimization Opportunities:**
   -   **C:** GCC can apply optimizations (e.g., loop unrolling, vectorization) during compilation, further boosting performance. These were not explicitly enabled here (e.g., using -O3), so even greater speedups are possible.
    -   **Python:** Lacks such low-level optimizations in its standard interpreter. Libraries like NumPy could improve performance by using compiled C code under the hood, but this assignment used pure Python for comparison.

Conclusively, **C outperforms Python** due to its compiled nature, direct memory control, and optimization capabilities, while Python’s ease of use comes at the cost of slower execution for computationally intensive tasks.


## Conclusion
This project provided me with valuable insights into the following technical areas:

-   **Command Line Operations:** Working with Unix commands in WSL enhanced familiarity with terminal-based workflows, including compiling, executing, and measuring program performance.
-   **Markdown Documentation:** Writing the report in Markdown and converting it to PDF with Pandoc demonstrated an efficient way to create structured, professional technical documentation, blending code and narrative seamlessly.
-   **Programming Language Differences:** Implementing matrix multiplication in C and Python highlighted key distinctions: C offers superior performance for numerical tasks due to its compiled nature and low-level control, while Python excels in rapid development and readability, though at a performance cost. The project underscored the trade-offs between development speed and execution efficiency.

Overall, this assignment has helped me reinforced the importance of choosing the right tool for the task and deepened understanding of algorithm implementation, verification, and performance analysis in a Linux environment.

## Appendix
The following were the observations I noted during the completion of the project assignment:

**WSL Experience:**
  -   Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provided a smooth transition from a Windows environment to a Linux-like setup. However, I encountered an issue installing GCC initially. Running sudo apt install gcc failed due to a missing package repository update, resulting in an error about unavailable packages. This was resolved by first running sudo apt update to refresh the package lists, followed by the install command. This experience highlighted the importance of ensuring the system’s package manager is up-to-date before installing new tools.
  
 **Learning Curve:**

-   Writing Markdown for the report was straightforward, but ensuring proper rendering in the PDF (e.g., code blocks, tables) required some trial and error with Pandoc. For instance, long code snippets occasionally overflowed the page without manual line breaks, suggesting a need to explore Pandoc’s formatting options further in future projects

**Verification Challenges:**

-   Verifying correctness for larger matrices manually was impractical, so reliance on small test cases and cross-checking between C and Python outputs was critical. This reinforced the value of automated testing frameworks for more complex projects.
